# How to Apply Ledger Statement Fix for ONLINE Payments

## Problem Summary
ONLINE payments to SARASWAT BANK are saved in the database with `bank_account_name`, but they don't appear in the Ledger Statement because:
1. The database function `get_ledger_statement_with_patients` is missing
2. Voucher entries are not being created for ONLINE payments

## Solution Files Created
1. `supabase/migrations/20251101000000_fix_online_payment_voucher_routing.sql` - Main fix
2. `supabase/migrations/20251101000001_backfill_online_payment_vouchers.sql` - Backfill existing data

**UPDATED:** Both migration files now handle voucher type code compatibility:
- Works with both 'REC' and 'RV' voucher types
- Automatically inserts 'REC' if missing
- No manual database changes needed!

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Apply the Main Migration

#### Option A: Using Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)

1. **Open Supabase SQL Editor**
   - Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/xvkxccqaopbnkvwgyfjv/sql
   - Click "New Query"

2. **Run the Main Migration**
   - Open file: `supabase/migrations/20251101000000_fix_online_payment_voucher_routing.sql`
   - Copy ALL contents (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C)
   - Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
   - Click **"Run"** button (or press Ctrl+Enter)

3. **Verify Success**

#### Option B: Using Supabase CLI

```bash
# If you have Supabase CLI installed
supabase db push
```

### Step 2: Backfill Existing ONLINE Payments

This creates voucher entries for ONLINE payments that were made BEFORE the fix.

1. **Open Supabase SQL Editor** (if not already open)
   - Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/xvkxccqaopbnkvwgyfjv/sql

2. **Run the Backfill Script**
   - Open file: `supabase/migrations/20251101000001_backfill_online_payment_vouchers.sql`
   - Copy ALL contents
   - Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
   - Click **"Run"**

3. **Review Results**
   - The script will show a table with all backfilled payments
   - Check the `status` column - should say "SUCCESS"
   - Note the voucher numbers created

---

### Step 3: Verify the Fix

1. **Open Ledger Statement Page**
   - Go to: http://localhost:8080/ledger-statement

2. **Search for SARASWAT BANK Transactions**
   - Select **"SARASWAT BANK"** from Account dropdown
   - Set date range: `27-10-2025` to `01-11-2025`
   - Click **"Search"**

3. **You Should See:**
   - All ONLINE payments to SARASWAT BANK
   - Payment details with correct amounts
   - Patient names and MRN numbers
   - Payment mode showing "ONLINE"

## What Each Migration Does

### Migration 1: `fix_online_payment_voucher_routing.sql`

✅ Creates the missing `get_ledger_statement_with_patients` function
✅ Updates payment trigger to handle ALL payment modes (not just CASH)
✅ Uses `bank_account_id` and `bank_account_name` from payment tables
✅ Routes ONLINE payments to correct bank accounts
✅ Ensures future payments automatically create vouchers

### Migration 2: `backfill_online_payment_vouchers.sql`

✅ Finds all existing ONLINE payments without vouchers
✅ Creates voucher entries retroactively
✅ Uses bank account information already in database
✅ Skips payments that already have vouchers (no duplicates)
✅ Marks backfilled entries for tracking

---

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Required voucher type or revenue account not found"
✅ **FIXED!** The updated migrations now automatically:
- Insert 'REC' voucher type if missing
- Work with both 'REC' and 'RV' codes
- Provide clear error messages if accounts are missing

If you still get this error after applying the updated migration:
1. Check that `chart_of_accounts` table has account_code '4000' with name 'INCOME'
2. Run: `SELECT * FROM voucher_types WHERE voucher_category = 'RECEIPT';`
3. If no results, the migration will auto-insert 'REC'

### Error: "Function already exists"
- This is OK! It means the migration was already applied
- Skip to Step 2 (backfill)

### Error: "Permission denied"
- Make sure you're logged into Supabase Dashboard
- Check that you have admin access to the project

### No payments showing in ledger after backfill
- Check the date range in the search filters
- Verify the bank account name matches exactly: "SARASWAT BANK"
- Check browser console for errors (F12)

### Backfill shows "SKIPPED" status
- Check the remarks field in advance_payment table
- Verify bank_account_name column has valid bank names
- Check that bank accounts exist in chart_of_accounts table

## Testing New ONLINE Payments

After applying both migrations, test with a new payment:

1. Create a new advance payment with payment mode = "ONLINE"
2. Select "SARASWAT BANK" as bank account
3. Save the payment
4. Go to Ledger Statement
5. Search for SARASWAT BANK with today's date
6. The payment should appear immediately!
