# Fix: Advance Payment Save Error

## Error

```
Failed to save advance payment: TypeError: Failed to fetch
```

---

## What's Happening?

After enabling ONLINE payment voucher creation, the trigger is now running for ALL payments. If the trigger fails, it blocks the entire payment save!

**The Problem:**
- Trigger tries to create voucher
- Something goes wrong (missing account, etc.)
- Trigger throws error
- **Payment save fails** ‚ùå

---

## The Solution ‚úÖ

I've created an improved trigger with **error handling** that:
- ‚úÖ Still tries to create vouchers
- ‚úÖ If voucher creation fails ‚Üí logs warning
- ‚úÖ Payment save still succeeds
- ‚úÖ You can save payments even if something is misconfigured

## What Changed?

**Before (Broken):**

IF error THEN
  RAISE EXCEPTION 'Error!';  ‚Üê Blocks payment save
END IF;
```

**After (Fixed):**
```sql
BEGIN
  -- Try to create voucher
  ...
EXCEPTION
  WHEN OTHERS THEN
    RAISE WARNING 'Error: %', SQLERRM;  ‚Üê Just logs warning
    -- Payment save continues! ‚úÖ
END;
```
